Course Syllabus for "ECON101-CLEP: Principles of Microeconomics"
----------------------------------------------------------------

Principles of Microeconomics belongs to the CLEP® PREP suite of Saylor
courses. This version of ECON101 will help you master the subject of
microeconomics and will help prepare you to take the [CLEP® exam in
microeconomics](http://clep.collegeboard.org/exam/microeconomics). The
purpose of this course is to provide you with a basic understanding of
the principles of microeconomics. At its core, the study of economics
deals with the choices and decisions that have to be made in order to
manage scarce resources available to us. Microeconomics is the branch of
economics that pertains to decisions made at the individual level, i.e.,
by individual consumers or individual firms after evaluating resources,
costs, and tradeoffs. When we talk about the economy, we are referring
to the marketplace or system in which these choices interact with one
another. In this course, you will learn how and why these decisions are
made and how they affect one another in the economy. Each of the
following units has been designed as a building block, where the
concepts you learn in one unit will enable you to understand the
material you discover in the next unit. By the end of this course, you
will have a strong grasp on the major issues that face microeconomists,
including consumer and producer behavior, the nature of supply and
demand, the different kinds of markets and how they function, and the
welfare outcomes of consumers and producers. You will also be able to
apply the formal principles you learn to real world issues. The scope
and emphasis of this course, like the CLEP® exam, goes beyond a general
understanding of microeconomics to incorporate the core concepts of the
overall field of economics. The College Board, the organization which
administers the AP and SAT exam programs you may have encountered or
taken in high school, designs the CLEP® (College Level Examination
Program) exams. CLEP® exams test for the mastery of college-level
material that you may have acquired through any number of ways – through
college-level course instruction, through independent study, through
work experience, or through any other program of study that you have
pursued. In other words, CLEP® exams are free-standing exams that any
individual can pay to take in order to prove that he or she has mastered
a given subject area at the college level. Over 2,900 US colleges and
universities recognize and award college credit for a satisfactory score
on a CLEP® exam. A student who earns a satisfactory score can be
eligible for the same amount of college credit as a student who has
successfully completed the same course at a traditional academic
institution. Prospective students interested in accelerated degree
programs are usually encouraged to take the CLEP® test. When you
successfully pass each test, you will receive college credit that can:
-   accelerate your degree;
-   allow you to skip beginner courses and/or to take higher-level
    courses faster;
-   help determine your readiness for classes;
-   apply knowledge you already have; and
-   save money on books and tuition.

All CLEP® exams are administered in multiple-choice format by computer.
The Principles of Microeconomics CLEP® exam contains 80 multiple choice
questions to be answered in 90 minutes. The fee for each CLEP® exam is
$80, plus any service fees payable to the testing center. However,
eligible military service members and civilian employees can take CLEP®
exams free of charge.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   identify how individual economic agents make rational choices given
    scarce resources, and explain how to optimize the use of resources
    at hand;
-   apply basic microeconomic models related to production, trade, and
    the circular flow of resources;
-   analyze and apply the mechanics of demand and supply for
    individuals, firms, and the market;
-   apply the concept of marginal analysis in order to make optimal
    choices, and identify whether the choices
    are *efficient* or *equitable*;
-   apply the concept of elasticity as a measure of responsiveness to
    various variables;
-   identify the characteristics of various market structures, namely,
    perfectly competitive markets, non-competitive markets, and
    imperfectly competitive markets, and compare and contrast their
    operations;
-   analyze how the demand and supply technique works for the resource
    markets; and
-   analyze the role of market failure in government decisions.
