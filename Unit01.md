**Unit 1: Introduction to Economics: What Is It?** <span id="1"></span> 
*Before we dive into the principles of microeconomics, we need to define
some of the major ideas that lie at the heart of economics. What, for
example, is the economic way of thinking? What do economists mean when
they throw around terms like market structure and the invisible hand?
This unit will identify and define these terms before addressing the
driving principle behind microeconomics: the idea that individuals and
firms (economic agents) make rational choices based on self-interest.
These decisions are necessary, because all resources are scarce. In
other words, no good or item is infinitely available. This unit will
also introduce you to a number of economic models, the assumptions and
constraints associated with each, and the ways they help us better
understand real-life situations.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 13.25 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 4 hours
☐    Subunit 1.1.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1.2: 1 hour

☐    Subunit 1.2: 5.5 hours

☐    Subunit 1.2.1: 3.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2.2: 2.25 hours

☐    Subunit 1.3: 0.75 hours

☐    Unit 1 Assessments: 3 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   explain the economic way of thinking;
-   identify how individual economic agents make rational choices given
    scarce resources, and explain how to optimize the use of resources
    at hand;
-   apply the concept of marginal analysis in order to make optimal
    choices, and identify whether the choices are*efficient* or
    *equitable*; and
-   apply basic economic models related to production, trade, and the
    circular flow of resources.

**1.1 Individual Choice: The Core of Economics** <span id="1.1"></span> 
**1.1.1 Scarce Resources, Choices, and Opportunity Costs** <span
id="1.1.1"></span> 
*The concept of opportunity cost is critical to understanding individual
choice, because you always have to give up something in order to get
another thing. In other words, the real cost of purchasing good A is
equal to the value of the next best alternative (good B) that you give
up in order to purchase good A. For example, what would you rather be
doing instead of studying this course? The task that you have forgone in
order to study economics is the opportunity cost of studying economics.*

     Instructions: This is an optional lecture and not a requirement of
    the course. In this unit, you learned that scarce resources underlie
    every economic decision that is made in society. You also learned
    that because of these scarce resources, there are trade-offs between
    alternate choices. In this guest lecture, Bjorn Lomborg advances
    this idea by discussing some pressing issues that need to be
    addressed. This talk should help you to identify the economic way of
    thinking, which will be elaborated upon in the next subunit.

    goals as you read through the chapter. Also, attempt the “Try It”
    problems for each section before checking your answers.  
      
     The first section of the chapter will introduce you to the four
    factors of production that are present in the economy: labor,
    capital, natural resources, and entrepreneurship. Using any two
    factors of production, you can then learn to construct the
    production possibility frontier (PPF) in a two plane model. Note the
    economic implications of the downward slope and the bowed-out shape
    of the PPF curve. Also, note the meaning of producing on the curve
    versus inside the curve. Lastly, think about what it means to move
    along the curve.  
      
     Reading these sections and completing the problems should take
    approximately 2 hours.

*This model is an application of the production possibility frontier
studied in the previous section, albeit in a global set-up. In this
subunit, we will bring the argument for international trade,
specialization, comparative advantage, and the resulting economic growth
to light. The mechanics of comparative advantage will reveal why it
would benefit a country to import goods it produces at home.*
