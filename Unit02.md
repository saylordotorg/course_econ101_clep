**Unit 2: Supply and Demand** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will first introduce you to the *ceteris paribus* assumption,
which is crucial to building correlations between economic variables.
When using *ceteris paribus*, we assume that all variables* – *with the
exception of those in explicit consideration* – *will remain
constant. We will then examine the supply and demand models and the
resulting market equilibrium that occurs where the supply curve and the
demand curve intersect. We will also look at what causes movements along
the curve and the set of factors that cause the curves to shift,
affecting both price and quantity, before discussing the meaning and
significance of elasticity.*  
  
 *Next, we will take a look at what happens when a market fails to
produce a reasonable equilibrium. This situation typically occurs when
either the market is not competitive or complete, or its participants
are ill-informed. We will evaluate various ways in which the government
can address these failures and begin to understand the intricate
relationship between government and economics.*

**2.1 The Ceteris Paribus Assumption** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*The Latin phrase* ceteris paribus *means* all other things remaining
equal*. Because there are multiple factors influencing any one variable,
we apply this assumption in order to segregate the effect that one
factor has on the variable in the question, keeping all other factors
unchanged. In other words, if we want to examine the effect of one
(independent) variable on another (dependent) variable, we need to
ensure through the ceteris paribus assumption that the effect of other
independent variables on the dependent variable is constant. We will
encounter this term quite often in demand and supply models.*

    Paribus”](http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=gls&c=dsp&k=ceteris+paribus) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this brief text to learn the formal definition
    of *ceteris paribus*. As a practice activity, identify a variable
    and list the multiple factors that may be influencing it. For
    example, say you are planning to request an increase in your
    salary. What are the factors that influence your salary? Do you
    think you can attribute the change in your salary to any *one* of
    these factors if all of the factors influencing it were
    simultaneously changing?  
      
     Reading this article and completing the activity described above
    should take approximately 15 minutes.

**2.2.1 The Demand Curve** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the material in subunit 2.2. The* demand
curve *shows the relationship between the price of a good and the
quantity demanded at each price. The demand curve is negatively sloped
because of the inverse relationship between price and quantity
demanded. For example, assuming that the ceteris paribus condition
applies, i.e., all other factors affecting demand remain unchanged, if
the price of an iPhone drops, what do you think will happen to the
demand for the iPhone? Conversely, if the price increases, would more
people be buying the iPhone or less?*

**2.2.2 Changes in Demand** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the material in subunit 2.2. Pay special
attention to *movement along the curve* versus *shifts of the
curve*. The former refers to changes in the quantity demanded due to
price changes. The latter refers to the breakdown of the *ceteris
paribus* condition. In order to understand shifts in demand curve, you
need to know that price remains constant and the shift of the demand
curve is in response to changes in other factors that affect demand,
including changes in the prices of related goods, changes in income,
changes in tastes, and changes in expectations.*  
  
 *The resulting effect is that a rightward shift of the curve indicates
an *increase in demand* and signifies that at any given price, consumers
demand a larger quantity of the good than before, while a* decrease in
demand*refers to a leftward shift of the curve and signifies that at any
given price, consumers demand a smaller quantity of the good than
before.*

**2.3.1 The Supply Curve** <span id="2.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the material in subunit 2.3. The supply
curve is a mirror reflection of the demand curve. You should recognize
that the supply curve operates from the firm’s point of view, such that
if a product is highly priced, the firm will want to supply more of it.
As such, it is a positively sloped curve indicating the positive
relationship between price of the good and quantity supplied.*

**2.3.2 Changes in Supply** <span id="2.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the material in subunit 2.3. The demand
curve is similar to the supply curve in that an* increase in supply
*refers to a rightward shift of the curve and signifies that there will
be a larger quantity of the good than before; a* decrease in supply
*refers to a leftward shift of the curve and signifies that there will
be a lesser quantity of the good than before. This section will present
the three principal factors that shift the supply curve: changes in
input prices, changes in technology, and changes in expectations.*

**2.4 Market Equilibrium** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*When left alone, a market will move to equilibrium*; *in other words,
the market price will move to the level at which the quantity supplied
equals the quantity demanded. However, this outcome can be both
desirable and undesirable for buyers or sellers.*

Elasticity *is a measure of responsiveness. It measures the percentage
change in something based on the percentage change in something else
that affects it. For example, price elasticity of demand implies the
percentage change in quantity demanded for a good due to a percentage
change in the price of that good.*

     Instructions: Watch this lecture, focusing on both how elasticity
    is calculated as well as its potential implications for health care.
    Consider if you agree or disagree with the possible social and
    health implications of changing the overall elasticity of demand for
    national health systems.
