title: "ECON101-CLEP: Principles of Microeconomics"
course_description: "An introductory course that provides a basic understanding of microeconomic principles. Analyzes the economic factors influencing decisions made at the individual level, after evaluating resources, costs, and tradeoffs. This version of ECON101 will help you master the subject of microeconomics and will help prepare you to take the CLEP exam in microeconomics."

**Unit 3: Markets and Individual Maximizing Behavior** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit will examine the ways in which markets increase overall
welfare through the concepts of consumer and producer surplus. We will
discuss the concepts of marginal costs and benefits and take a look at
how they affect a firm’s decision on whether or not to make one more or
one less product.*  
  
 *We have already learned that, at its most fundamental level,
microeconomics is the study of how we make decisions. To expand on this
point, we need to distinguish between the* either/or*decision and the*
how much *decision. You will find this concept useful when looking more
closely at why firms produce certain levels of output, taking into
consideration opportunity cost and sunk (fixed) cost.*  
  
 *This unit concludes with the causes and ramifications of income
inequality. While there is much debate about how to address long term
inequality, economists can objectively measure the problem’s scope and
offer options to manage this economic phenomenon. Protracted poverty and
inequality can cause long term harm to an economy’s development.*

    Section 2”**

    Section
    2”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Microeconomics.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Section 6.1 to revisit the concept of marginal
    costs and benefits within the context of the consumer’s (and the
    firm’s) maximizing behavior. Proceed to read Section 6.2, which
    defines two new concepts: *consumer surplus* and *producer
    surplus*. Take a moment to read through the stated learning outcomes
    for this chapter of the text, which you can find at the beginning of
    each section. These outcomes should be your goals as you read
    through the chapter. Attempt the “Try It” problem for each
    section.  
      
     Reading these sections and completing the problems should take
    approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Watch this video about how an apple farmer decides
    the optimal number of apples to pick. At the end of the video,
    consider whether or not the government should intervene. Think about
    which arguments you might make both supporting and disagreeing with
    the government acting in the market. In 3.2, we will cover specific
    ways the government might participate in the market.

**3.2 When Markets Fail** <span id="3.2"></span> 
Market failure *refers to a situation in which there is an inefficient
allocation of goods and services in the market. Inefficient allocation
takes place when pure self-interest drives the maximizing behavior of
economic agents. Market failure is attributed to the existence of
externalities, common property resources, public goods, and asymmetric
information. Market failure often leads to government intervention
designed to drive the market towards efficiency.*
