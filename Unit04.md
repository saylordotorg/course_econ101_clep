**Unit 4: The Consumer** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit will focus on the individual consumer and the characteristics
that compel a consumer (to choose) to spend income on goods and
services. The consumer experiences utility *– *a measure of
satisfaction* – *with every purchase that he or she makes, and
economists measure that utility in order to find a consumer’s optimal
rate of consumption. The Theory of Demand is derived from the Theory of
Consumer Behavior presented in this unit. An individual’s demand
function can be explained by two approaches that help illustrate
personal preferences:* utility analysis*and* indifference analysis*. You
will explore these concepts more fully in this unit.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 15.75 hours.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   identify and describe the basic tenets of consumer theory through
    two alternate approaches: the utility analysis and the indifference
    analysis; and
-   correlate the derivation of the theory of demand to the theory of
    consumer behavior.

    Nutshell”](http://www3.uakron.edu/econ/MidwestConference/2003/2003Presentations/paul-cover-page.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Use these three interactive online exercise sets to
    better understand the concepts in Utility Theory: Exercise 1 Budget
    Constraint, Exercise 2 Indifference Curves, and Exercise 3 Utility
    Maximization. You will need a paper and pen to practice sketching
    the graphs. The first two exercises will enable you to draw the
    budget constraint (BC) and indifference curves (IC) based on the
    values of the parameters you have chosen. Change the values of the
    original parameters to see how the BC and IC also change. As you go
    along, ask why these shifts might occur. In the last exercise, you
    will combine the BC and IC to determine optimization. Be sure to
    answer the questions at the end of each exercise.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 2 hours.
