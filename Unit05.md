**Unit 5: The Producer** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about one of the most important economic
agents: the producer. The producer (firm) is responsible for creating
the production function (output) and is subject to various cost measures
as well as the results of diminishing returns. You will explore these
ideas more fully as you delve into the relationship between quantity of
input and quantity of output. This unit will discuss how and why a
firm’s costs may differ in the short run versus the long run.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 9.5 hours.
☐    Subunit 5.1: 4.5 hours

☐    Introduction: 1 hour

☐    Subunit 5.1.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1.2: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Unit 5 Review: 1.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Unit 5 Assessments: 2.25 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   analyze the behavior of the producer;
-   compare the costs of production in the short run to costs of
    production in the long run;
-   identify the production function in the short run as well as the
    long run; and
-   compute the relationship between different cost functions.
