**Unit 6: Market Structure: Competitive and Non-competitive Markets**
<span id="6"></span> 
*This unit will introduce the concept of* perfect competition*, an ideal
model that serves as a benchmark against which real-world market
structures are analyzed. Also known as the model of *pure
competition*, perfect competition results in an efficient allocation of
resources. In the real world, however, unregulated markets (which are
central to perfect competition) may fail to create desired outcomes for
a number of reasons. Economists refer to these situations as examples of
imperfect competition.  
  
 In this unit, you will first study the Model of Perfect Competition and
then move on to what may be considered the antithesis of perfect
competition, the Monopoly Model. You will then learn about imperfect
competition and the two models that fall under it:* monopolistic
competition*and* oligopoly*. This unit will also touch upon game theory
through the Prisoner’s Dilemma Model and a discussion of the Nash
Equilibrium.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   identify the characteristic differences between various market
    structures, namely, perfectly competitive markets, non-competitive
    markets, and imperfectly competitive Markets, and discuss
    differences in their operations; and
-   compare and contrast as well as discuss the three main kinds of
    economic systems.

    Markets for Goods and Services”**

    Markets for Goods and
    Services”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Microeconomics.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 9 for an understanding of the model of
    perfect competition, which is crucial to your understanding of the
    more complicated and realistic models that will be studied
    next. Take a moment to read through the stated learning outcomes for
    this chapter of the text, which you can find at the beginning of
    each section. These outcomes should be your goals as you read
    through the chapter. Attempt the “Try It” problems at the end of
    each section. This reading covers the topics outlined in subunits
    6.1.1–6.1.4.  
      
     Reading this chapter and completing the problems should take
    approximately 3.5 hours.

     Instructions: Please go through this tutorial to examine a model of
    a firm in a perfectly competitive market. With the help of demand
    curves, revenue curves, and cost curves, the tutorial will also
    teach you how demand in the market affects firm behavior and how an
    industry supply curve can be derived from the model of the perfectly
    competitive firm.

**6.3 Imperfect Competition** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*You have studied two extreme forms of market structure*: *one with
infinite producers (perfect competition) and one with a single producer
(monopoly). Realistically, within the spectrum of these two models, the
vast majority of firms exist in an imperfectly competitive setting where
at least one firm is a price setter. You will now study two other broad
categories in the world of imperfect competition: one in which many
firms compete (monopolistic competition* – *for example, the market for
restaurants in a city) and another in which few firms compete
(oligopoly* – *for example, the cell phone industry).*
